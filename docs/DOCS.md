## Zoom/Stretch Modes

Pressing zoom cycles though the following modes

*   **constrain**

    scale down so the image fits the view but
    never larger than its actual size

*   **stretch**

    scale up or down to fit the view

*   **cover**

    scales so that the entire view is covered by
    the image even of part of that image ends up offscreen

*   **actual size**

    Just what it says.

*   **fit width**

    scale until the image fills the width of the view

*   **fit height**

    scale until the image fills the height of the view

## Rotation

There are 2 types of rotation

1. When a video or image is being viewed and that pane has
   the focus then rotate rotates
   that viewer.

2. When a thumbnail pane has the focus then rotate
   rotates the entire UI

   The point of rotating the entire UI is to re-orient
   your laptop to better fit the topic you're
   viewing.

   Note that at the moment the feature is designed for
   laptops and trackpads. See FAQ.

## Filters

filters help you find images.

Just typing letters matches the entire path. So for example `gif`
matches both `spinning-n.gif` and `gifs/nerf.jpg`. `.gif` would match
both `christmas.gifts/nuts.png` and `neptune.gif`

words that end in a colon `:` are considered a special filter. 

*   `width:`
*   `height:`
*   `aspect:`
*   `size:`

all of these take a comparison and a number. Examples

    width:>1000
    height:<=512
    aspect:>1
    size:20k

`aspect` can also be `aspect:landscape` and `aspect:portrait`
which are just synonyms for `aspect:>1` and `aspect:<1` respectively.

`size` and can take the following case insensitive suffixes

*   `k`, `kb`
*   `m`, `mb`
*   `g`, `gb`
*   `t`, `tb`

examples

    size:>100mb
    size:>1.5gb

*   `date:`

takes a date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format as in

    date:<2015
    date:>2018-02-15

*    `folder:` 
*    `dir:`
*    `dirname:`

work the same as above but only match the folder portion
so `folder:nuts` would match `nuts/almond.jpg` but not
`collections/nuts.gif`

*    `basename:`
*    `filename:`

Do the same for just the base name of the file so
`filename:new` would match `animals/newts.mp4` but
not `newspapers/post.png`.

*    `bad:` 

Will show files that could not be opened for some reason.

*    `type:`

Filters on mime-types so for example `type:video` would
show all videos and `type:image/gif` would show all gifs.

### Comparison Operators

*    `>` greater than
*    `>=` greater than or equal to
*    `<` less than
*    `<=` less than or equal to
*    `==` equal to
*    `===` equal to
*    `!=` not equal to 
*    `!==` not equal to

Comparison operators only work with `width:`, `height:`,
`aspect:`, `size:`, and `date:`.
